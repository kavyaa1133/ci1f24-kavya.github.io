        <p>Central Park is my sanctuary amidst the urban chaos. The lush greens evoke a sense of tranquility, reminiscent of my childhood in Antwerp, where nature felt more accessible. Every visit to the park brings back memories of lazy summer afternoons spent playing outside, and that connection to nature becomes a source of grounding in a concrete jungle. When I step into the park, the vibrant greens seem to envelop me in a comforting embrace, reminding me of the importance of balance between nature and city life.</p>
        <p>The cool earth tones reflect the changing seasons, bringing me peace and encouraging me to reflect on my journey as I watch families picnicking and artists painting the landscape. Central Park symbolizes my desire to find moments of calm and connection in a city that often feels overwhelming.</p>
