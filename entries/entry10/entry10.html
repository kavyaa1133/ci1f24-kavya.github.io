            <p>The gleaming copper of the Statue of Liberty, standing tall in New York Harbor, symbolizes both freedom and the city’s unyielding spirit. Its warm gold tones shimmer in the sunlight, representing the hope, strength, and opportunity that New York extends to all who arrive.</p>
            <p>Over time, the statue has transformed, from gleaming copper to its iconic green patina, reflecting the city’s resilience and its ability to evolve while holding onto its core values. This gradual change reminds me of the passage of time and the beauty in adapting while maintaining one's essence.</p>
            <p>To me, the Statue of Liberty represents the courage to embrace change and the strength to overcome obstacles. It is a symbol of belief—reminding me that in New York, dreams can come true.</p>
            <p>Just as the statue has welcomed millions of newcomers, it mirrors my own journey of finding my place in this ever-changing city. Its copper, gold, and green hues remind me that even in moments of uncertainty, hope remains, guiding me forward.</p>
